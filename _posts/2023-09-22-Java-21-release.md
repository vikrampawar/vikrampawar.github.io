Java 21 is released. The following have caught my attention
- It's an LTS, and from now on LTS will be released every 2 years
- Java virtual threads (Project Loom) is now part of the JDK
- Data oriented programming is now possible with improvements in Pattern matching, sealed classes, records, text blocks, and switch expressions.
