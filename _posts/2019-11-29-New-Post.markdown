I have not posted anything for about an year.
I forgot how blogging with github works.
Luckily it's not too much of a hassle to figure out how this works.

To generate a new post, add a new file to the github repository called yourname.github.io. The file should match the pattern
`ccyy-mm-dd-title.markdown` . Commit and push to github. For example the current post is called `2019-11-29-New-Post.markdown` and resides under the folder `_posts` within the repo `vikrampawar.githbub.io`. 
That's all. 


Make sure you insert a layout at the top that resembles

{% highlight bash%}
