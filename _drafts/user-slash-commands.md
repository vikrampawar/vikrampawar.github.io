it's quite easy to save prompts along with placeholders that are easily accessed from Claude Code using slash commands.

For example I'm currently using claude code a lot to write blog posts.

I'm using a simple workflow now.

I jot down ideas with just enough words that I'm sure would make sense to claude code.

Then ask cc to read the document and create a blog post.

I'll implement it using  this feature.

creating a command called create-a-blog-post-from <arguments>

Then in claude I can use it as a slash command  

explain how to setup a command
