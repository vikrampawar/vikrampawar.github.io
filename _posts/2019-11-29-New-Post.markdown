I have not posted anything for about an year.
I forgot how blogging with github works.
Luckily it's not too much of a hassle to figure out how this works.

To generate a new post, create a file name with the pattern
ccyy-mm-dd-title.markdown and commit and push to github. 
That's all. 


Make sure you insert a layout at the top that resembles

{% highlight bash%}
