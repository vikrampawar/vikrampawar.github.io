- it's like collaborating, so keep at it longer and often
- we write to figure things out - we figure more now as we can just write brief bullet points for each thought.
- we focus on real thinking rather than the mechanics of writing similarity with using ai for programming.
- thinking more about what to write is a way to focus thinking and work
- helps in a way how TDD helps shape work. TDD ensures that code is written in way that it's testable in small chunks. We'll focus on doing work in small chunks that can be explained in a blog post.
