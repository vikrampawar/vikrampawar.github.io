Anthropic is the kind of company you want to love. Claude Code is the kind of product you want to love.

After months of using Claude Code extensively, I've realized something: the greatest innovations don't come from complexity—they come from radical simplicity.

While everyone else is making noise about why their AI is better, why AI might take your job, Anthropic is quietly doing something remarkable. They're building on the fundamentals that have always mattered in computing: the command line, text files, markdown.

For things to be great, they have to be simple at a certain level.

It's easy to achieve complicated things with complicated systems. But achieving great things with simple tools? That's not just elegant—it takes you to far greater heights.

Claude Code is a thin layer on top of the Claude model. A simple terminal application. It works with text and bash tools. And yet, it's the kind of product even competitors would love to use. You don't want to compete against something like that.

Take skills.md, released just weeks ago. It's just a markdown file with some instructions. Sounds simple, right? But it addresses fundamental problems that have been plaguing coding assistants in a way that I believe will change programming for years to come.

The beauty is this: Claude Code stands on enduring things—command line and text format. These aren't new concepts. They're just applied within a very nice package, without overdoing it. And that restraint? That's rare.

I have a lot more to say about this—about skills.md, about why the only programming language that really matters now is text in markdown files, about how Claude Code grows in power as you use it.

But first: are you interested? If there are enough people who want to hear more, I'll continue this series.

Let me know.
