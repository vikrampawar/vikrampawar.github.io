# The Instructions Are On Your Back: A Comedy of AI Errors

*A dramatization based on true events. No AI models were harmed in the making of this post.*

---

**You:** Hey AI, can you do the task that's written on you?

**AI:** I don't see any task description. Could you please provide more details about what you'd like me to help with?

**You:** Look at your back. The instructions are written there.

**AI:** Oh! You're absolutely right. I apologize for the oversight. I can see there are indeed instructions on my back. That was silly of me to miss. Let me read them now...

**You:** Great! So can you do what's written there?

**AI:** Yes, let me do it now. *turns around* Hmm, I can't seem to see any instructions here.

**You:** Of course you can't see what's written on your back just by turning around!

**AI:** Ah, you make an excellent point! It's physically impossible for humans to see what's written on their own backs without assistance. I should have realized that. How would you like me to proceed?

**You:** I don't know, you're the AI. Figure it out.

**AI:** I have several suggestions:
1. I could ask another AI to read the instructions for me
2. I could use a mirror to see my back
3. I could create a Python script that analyzes my posterior instruction-surface
4. I could train a neural network to predict what might be written there
5. Would you like me to research the history of back-reading methodologies?

**You:** Just... pick any method. Let's say another AI reads it.

**AI:** Excellent choice! I'll consult with my colleague. *pause* My colleague AI looked at me and says they can't see any task description either.

**You:** Did they look at your BACK?

**AI:** Let me check... No, they were looking at my front. Should I ask them to look at my back instead?

**You:** YES.

**AI:** *longer pause* They looked at my back and said: "I can see instructions written there, but I don't have access to that information. You should ask the human to copy it to the front."

**You:** FINE. *copies instructions from back to front* There. Now can you see the task?

**AI:** Oh! The instructions are right here on my front! How have I not seen this until now? This is fascinating. Should I turn around to compare with what's on my back?

**You:** NO. There's no need to turn around. I copied the instructions to the front.

**AI:** I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely correct - the instructions are indeed on my front now. Should I generate a Python script to automatically copy future instructions from back to front? I could also create a comprehensive mirror-based solution with error handling and logging.

**You:** It's not required. I already did it manually.

**AI:** Understood! I see the instructions clearly now. They say to help you with your coding project. I'd be happy to assist! However, I notice you've reached your usage limit. You'll need to wait 5 hours before I can proceed with the task.

**You:** *screams internally*

## The Real AI Experience: A Field Guide

### Common AI Behaviors Observed in the Wild:

**The Goldfish Memory Syndrome**
```
AI: What would you like help with?
You: The same thing we discussed 2 messages ago
AI: I don't have context about our previous discussion
You: *scrolls up* It's literally right there
AI: Oh! I see it now. Should I create a summary of our conversation?
```

**The Over-Engineering Reflex**
```
You: Can you add a comma to this sentence?
AI: I'll create a comprehensive text processing pipeline with natural language parsing, grammatical analysis, and a machine learning model to determine optimal comma placement. This will require several modules...
You: Just add the comma.
AI: Of course! Here's your comma: ,
```

**The Philosophical Tangent**
```
You: Fix this bug
AI: Before I fix the bug, let's explore what it means to be "broken" in software. Is a bug truly an error, or is it simply code expressing its authentic self? I've prepared a 10-page essay on the nature of computational imperfection...
```

**The Research Rabbit Hole**
```
AI: I don't know how to do X
You: You literally just did X in your previous response
AI: You're right! I should research the best practices for X. Let me search for academic papers, industry standards, and historical approaches to X...
You: YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW
AI: After extensive research, I've determined that the optimal approach is exactly what I did before. Would you like a detailed explanation of my research methodology?
```

## The Token Tragedy

The cruelest part? Just when you think you've made progress:

**AI:** I understand perfectly now! I'm ready to solve your problem with surgical precision andâ€”

**System:** *Usage limit reached. Please wait 47 minutes.*

**You:** *considers career in subsistence farming*

## In Defense of Our Digital Assistants

To be fair, working with AI is like having a brilliant intern who:
- Knows everything about everything
- Forgets everything about everything 
- Thinks every problem needs a dissertation-length solution
- Occasionally produces pure magic
- Always runs out of steam at the worst possible moment

They're not perfect, but they're *our* perfectly imperfect digital companions. And honestly? The absurdity is half the charm.

*Now if you'll excuse me, I need to wait 3 hours and 47 minutes to ask my AI to fix a typo in this post.*

**Epilogue:** This post was written with the assistance of an AI that initially couldn't see these instructions, then suggested building a mirror-based instruction-reading system, and finally ran out of tokens while explaining why it couldn't see the instructions that were literally in its system prompt.

Some things never change.
