- if it's already deployed as I had in mac, it may realise that you are now a subscriber. Process was smoother on linux where it was not already deployed.
- Concept of self isn't strong, some time understand what 'you' means and sometimes not. Find it difficult to make it understand it's own problems. Found the same with copilot. Related is that it doesn't understand it's relation with claude desktop. I already had mcps configured for claude desktop, it couldn't get to the command to copy the mcp config. I had to ask it to write to memory.
- also claude ai/desktop and claude code are not as integrated as you'd expect/want, they treat each other as separate things
- Using memory - isn't straighforward - many ways of doing it, so not quickly apparently how to make it remember anything more than what it does out of the box. Can use CLAUDE.md files and also memory mcp.
- waiting for responses after the start jekyll blog command. Saying the blog is live when it's not etc, how I made it write a script to do all the checks before saying that it's live.
