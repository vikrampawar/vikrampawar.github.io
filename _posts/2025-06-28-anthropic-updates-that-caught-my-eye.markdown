>This might imply that as AI agents become more commonplace, and as more agentic AI products are built, we should expect more automation of tasks.

>Since so much of AI research and development relies on software, it’s possible that advancements in AI-assisted coding help to speed up breakthroughs, creating a positively-reinforcing cycle that accelerates AI progress even further.

>In the grand scheme of things, AI systems are extremely new. But in a relative sense, coding is among the most developed uses of AI in the economy. That makes it worth watching. Although we can’t assume that the lessons we draw from software development will directly carry over to other types of occupation, software development might be a leading indicator that gives us useful information about how other occupations might change with the rollout of increasingly capable AI models in the future.
