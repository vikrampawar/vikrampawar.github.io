Notes from 'Practical common lisp'


Simple list expression 10. Every expression evaluates to some result.

It is a self-evaluating object. So are strings like "Hello, World"

Anything in parenthesis is a list

`(+ 2 3)`

+ is a function
2 and 3 evaluate to themselves

`format` function takes at least two parameters, first one 't' implies output is to standard output. The second is the string. It has side effects

`NIL` is false and or null

defun defines a function

`(defun hello-world() (format t "hello, world"))`

Can be called as 

`(hello-world)`

functions return the value of the last expression evaluated
