Today I upgraded to the Claude Code Max plan, and I wanted to share my reasoning behind this decision.

## Life on the Starter Plan

The basic Starter plan operates on 5-hour windows that reset after each period. Since starting with Claude Code on June 5th, I've hit this limit fewer than 5 times. Each time, I only had to wait less than an hour for the reset, so the limitation wasn't particularly painful.

However, staying within these limits required careful planning and deliberate constraints:

### My Starter Plan Strategy

1. **Strategic Timing**: I'd start early in the day to ensure I could have two sessions during work hours. If I hit the limit in the first session, I knew I'd have another window later.

2. **Model Selection**: I exclusively used Sonnet, never trying Opus to conserve usage.

3. **Conservative Usage**: 
   - Used only one terminal at a time
   - Carefully reviewed all suggested changes before implementing
   - Only requested multiple parallel agents when nearing the 5-hour window or when I knew I wouldn't need Claude Code soon after
   - Kept automatic edits disabled most of the time

### The Silver Lining

This measured pace actually helped me learn Claude Code more thoroughly. By watching and understanding each interaction, I developed a better sense of how to integrate it effectively into my workflows. Despite these constraints, I made significant progress on my development tasks.

## Why Upgrade Now?

Now that I have a solid understanding of Claude Code's capabilities, I'm ready to explore its more advanced features without constantly managing limitations:

1. **Opus Without Worry**: I want to use the more powerful Opus model when tasks require it, without fear of burning through my allocation.

2. **Parallel Workflows**: I'm eager to try multiple agents working on single requests and run sessions across multiple terminals when it makes sense.

3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No more timing my sessions or rationing features - I can focus purely on the work.

## The Price Consideration

The jump from £15 to £75 per month isn't trivial - it's a 5x increase. For context, my most expensive developer subscription until now has been O'Reilly Safari at around £35/month. 

What made this decision easier was my commitment to the [single-minded focus experiment](/2025/06/19/the-focus-experiment/) I mentioned in a previous post. When you're deliberately concentrating on mastering one tool, the investment becomes more justifiable.

## Looking Ahead

Will the Max plan be worth the significant price increase? Time will tell. I'll be sharing my experiences in future posts, including:

- How my usage patterns change without limits
- Whether Opus delivers noticeably better results for complex tasks
- If parallel agents truly accelerate development
- The actual ROI in terms of productivity gains

Stay tuned for the verdict!
