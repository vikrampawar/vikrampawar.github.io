Although ai helps a lot and makes us producticve, there are times when they are can really make us frustrated in a funny way. I have this idea for a humourous post on how it can be frustrating sometimes to work with ai agents. Need to write it out more properly.

  Some conversations can feel like this. Imagine a human. Ask it do some task whose description is on them. We may can you do what's written on you. They look down and say they can't see any task description written. Then you tell them, look at your back, it's written. They'll yeah you are right, it's silly of me, there are instructions on the back. Then you remind them that you had asked them to do what's written. They say yes let me do it now, turn around look at them themselves and say I can't see any instructions. Then you tell them you won't be able to see what's written on the back just by turning around. They'll respond saying yeah it's not possible for humans to see what's writtne on their backs. You'll tehn say how can we make claude do it. They'll respond with several suggestions say 1) ask another human to read it for them 2) use a mirror etc. You tell pick any method. Let's say they pick a human to read. That human only looks at the front and they return back saying they still can't see any description. At this point, you are frustrated and copy the matter from the back to the front and say now see the instructions. They'll respond saying oh the instructions are there how have not seen this until now. And then start turning around. You'll tell them, there is no need to turn now as you've copied the instructions in the front. They'll apologize and then say yets the instructions are indeed in the front should I generate a way to copy from behind? You'll say it's not required, I've done it manually. They agree and say your limit is reached you'll haev to wait for another 5 hours.
