Yesterday I mentioned the real magic happens when you combine Wispr with AI. Here's what I mean:

When you use Wispr properly:

You're not stopping in between much, so you enter into a state of flow where you're able to talk for a very long time in pretty coherent sentences.

And even if you don't speak coherently, or some sentences are not that great, you can always get the AI to go through the whole thing and polish it a bit.

Think about that for a moment: the amount of text you can get cleaned up this way is phenomenal.

You don't have to worry too much about organizing this text into a form that's consumable by another human being. If you've written for a very long time, you know that for something to be really understandable by other people, you have to put a lot of effort after the initial brainstorming sessions.

In these sessions, you're trying to:
- Reorganize what you've written
- Proofread
- Fix spelling mistakes
- Take out words and sentences
- Add new sentences
- Reformat sentences

All of this takes so much time, and it doesn't really add much value. At the end of the day, you're not understanding something new. All that you had to say was already there in your head and came out during the initial brainstorming.

Yes, reorganizing can bring clarity. But that clarity isn't worth the hours of tedious editing.

If you let AI process whatever you said, you get the same clarity—or better—with the content properly organized and consumable.

This is the new workflow:
1. Speak naturally using Wispr (input side solved)
2. Let AI organize and polish (processing)
3. Review the final output (output side - the constraint I discussed in previous posts)

You're still the human in the loop for review. But you've eliminated the input bottleneck and the tedious editing work that adds little value.

Wispr doesn't just solve the typing speed problem. Combined with AI, it changes how you can think and create. You speak, the AI cleans it up and organizes it, and you review the final product.

That's why I paid for it. That's why, as a developer who rarely buys tools, this one immediately made the cut.

The future of work isn't just about better AI. It's about removing the constraints that prevent us from working with AI at the speed of thought.

Wispr removes the input constraint. The output side—reviewing at scale—remains the challenge we all need to solve.
