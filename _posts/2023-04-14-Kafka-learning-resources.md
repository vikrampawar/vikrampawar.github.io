Today I've created a notion database to keep track of all the resources I've found useful for learning Kafka. I'll keep adding to it as I find more resources. 

Here is the publicly accessible link to the database - [Kafka Learning Resources Notion Database](https://sincere-wildflower-595.notion.site/409619ed704344e38af90c26df8a1774?v=e111c8100a7e45ec9b933b762dc31d90).
