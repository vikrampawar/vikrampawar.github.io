Today I've upgraded to Max plan.

The basic starter plan has a 5 hour window after which it resets.

I've only reached the limit less 5 times since I started using Claude Code on June 5th. And on every occasion I only had to wait for less than an hour or so before it reset. So didn't I feel the limitation.

I was cautious in my usage and a few things helped me to stay within the limit and still be productive. 

I'd start early so I can have two sessions during the work day. If I hit the limit soon in the first session, I know I'll have another session later.

I use only Sonnet never tried Opus.

I used only one terminal and reviewed the suggestions carefully when it suggested changes.

I only asked it to use multiple parallel agents when I was nearing the 5 hour window or when I was certain I won't get much time with Claude Code in the next 5 hour window.

I did not turn automatic edits on most of the time.

As I was learning to integrate Claude Code into my workflows, this slow pace helped to watch and learn about Claude Code.

Yet I think  I was able to use it sufficiently well and make good progress on my development tasks.

Now I have a good sense of it, so want to try out more advanced features.

First I want to be able to use Opus without worrying about limits.

Then I want to try out using multiple agents to work on a single request and also have sessions in multiple terminals whenever it makes sense.

Even then I'd still be hesitating to go from £15 per month to £75 per month.
The most expensive developer perk I enjoy now is the subscription I have to Oreilly Safari which is around £35. So this is a significant jump. The only reason I'm okay to do this is because of this single minded focus on Claude Code that I'm trying to cultivate as I mentioned in [post](2025-06-20-the-focus-experiment.markdown).

I'll let you know if it was worth it in the future posts.
