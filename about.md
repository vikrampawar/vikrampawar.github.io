## The Focus Experiment

I'm an experienced software developer conducting a radical focus experiment inspired by Steve Jobs' philosophy: 

> "Focus means saying NO to something that—with every bone in your body—you think is a phenomenal idea."

### The Decision

While the tech world chases every new AI tool and coding assistant, I've made a counterintuitive choice: **I'm betting everything on Claude Code**. 

Not just for development, but for:
- Content creation and writing
- Research and analysis
- Project management
- Building deep expertise
- Workflow optimization

### The Goal

My goal is ambitious but specific: **Become the most knowledgeable person about Claude Code among the people I meet.**

This isn't about ignoring innovation—it's about the compound effects of mastery. By saying no to the noise, I'm saying yes to depth.

### What You'll Find Here

This blog documents my journey through:

- **Technical Discoveries**: Pushing Claude Code to its limits
- **Workflow Patterns**: Building efficient, repeatable processes
- **Integration Strategies**: Making Claude Code the hub of my development ecosystem
- **Learning Insights**: The unexpected benefits of deep focus
- **Real-World Applications**: Practical examples from actual projects

### Why This Matters

In an era of tool fatigue and constant context switching, this experiment tests a simple hypothesis: Can focusing on one tool deeply outperform spreading attention across many?

Early results suggest yes. The compound learning effects, workflow optimizations, and mental clarity from this approach have been transformative.

### Join the Journey

Whether you're a Claude Code user, someone interested in developer productivity, or just curious about focused learning experiments, I invite you to follow along.

The experiment continues, and the best discoveries are yet to come.
