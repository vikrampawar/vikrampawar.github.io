I'm a software developer conducting a focus experiment inspired by Steve Jobs' philosophy: "Focus means saying NO to something that—with every bone in your body—you think is a phenomenal idea."

Instead of juggling multiple AI tools and coding assistants, I've made a radical decision: I'm betting everything on Claude Code. Not just for development, but for content creation, research, project management, and building expertise.

My goal is ambitious but specific: become the most knowledgeable person about Claude Code applications in London. Every day I explore new ways to push this agentic coding tool beyond its obvious use cases, documenting patterns and possibilities that emerge from deep, focused practice.

This blog captures that journey—from technical discoveries to workflow optimizations to the compound learning effects of going deep instead of wide.

The experiment continues.
