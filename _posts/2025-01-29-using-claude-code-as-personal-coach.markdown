As I'm focussing on Claude Code, I want to use it for anything I can think of.
I'll be changing my workflows so I'm able to use Claude Code for any purpose I can think of.

I write daily journals. These are generally spread out in Notion, Google docs and markdown files depending on what feels most important to be at that time or what I have access to.

However now that I'm serious about using Claude Code, I'll be writing my journal entries in markdown files so I can have CC read it and help me in any way it can.

I keep only for file for the year usually so it's easily to just refer to it and ask questions.

Today I asked it to find all the ideas related to CLaude Code and it returned :

```

# Claude Code Personal Coach

## June 29, 2025 - Direction for Claude Code Focus

Based on your Claude Code objectives, here are my suggestions for what will help most:

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

**1. Combat the listless feeling with small wins:**
- Write one short blog post today about a specific Claude Code feature you've used
- Share a quick tip on X/Twitter about Claude Code
- Spend 30 minutes on your morning walk thinking about your "Why Claude Code Now" post

**2. Build momentum through consistency:**
- Set a schedule: Monday/Thursday for blog posts
- Use your morning walks as "Claude Code thinking time"
- Keep a running list of blog post ideas on your phone

### Strategic Focus Areas

**1. Content Creation System:**
- Use Claude Code itself to help write your blog posts (meta approach)
- Create templates for different post types (tutorials, tips, case studies)
- Document your own Claude Code usage as content

**2. Showcase Projects:**
- Focus on completing Prompt Tracker - it's tangible proof of your expertise
- Document the development process as a case study
- Create before/after comparisons showing productivity gains

**3. Networking & Visibility:**
- Join Anthropic's Discord/community if available
- Engage with other Claude Code users on social media
- Consider attending AI meetups in London (you mentioned this interest)

### Anti-Procrastination Strategy

Since you mentioned feeling listless:
- Start each day with the smallest possible Claude Code task
- Use your successful morning walk habit as an anchor
- Track streaks (like your 150-day challenges) for blog posting

The key is maintaining momentum through consistent small actions rather than waiting for motivation.
