# Bash Tool Jekyll Serve Hanging Issue

## Problem Description

When using the Bash tool to run `bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000 --detach`, the tool appears to hang indefinitely, even though the command actually executes successfully.

## Observable Behavior

1. **Command Output**: The command produces the expected output:
   - Shows configuration loading
   - Displays build warnings and errors (PNG file issues)
   - Shows "Server detached with pid 'XXXXX'"
   - Indicates server address: http://0.0.0.0:3000/

2. **Actual Success**: The Jekyll server does start and is accessible at the specified port

3. **Tool Behavior**: Despite successful execution, the Bash tool doesn't return control and appears to wait indefinitely

4. **User Intervention Required**: User must press escape to interrupt the tool and regain control

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. Detached Process Monitoring
The `--detach` flag creates a background process. The Bash tool might be:
- Waiting for the detached child process instead of recognizing parent completion
- Monitoring the wrong process ID
- Not understanding that detachment means the parent command is complete

### 2. Output Stream Handling
The command produces extensive warning output (Ruby deprecation warnings, URI conflicts). The tool might be:
- Waiting for all stderr streams to close
- Buffering output and waiting for more
- Not recognizing completion due to ongoing warning streams

### 3. Tool Implementation Limitation
The Bash tool might have issues with:
- Commands that fork background processes
- Long-running server processes
- Commands with extensive warning output

## Current Workarounds

### 1. Non-Detached Mode
Use `bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000` without --detach flag:
- **Pros**: Tool behavior is predictable
- **Cons**: Requires manual termination, blocks tool until stopped

### 2. Shorter Timeout
Set explicit timeout for detached commands:
- **Pros**: Prevents indefinite hanging
- **Cons**: May timeout before completion, arbitrary timeout values

### 3. Alternative Commands
Use separate build and serve commands:
- `bundle exec jekyll build` (for build testing)
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` (for local development)

## Recommended Solutions

### Short-term
1. **Use non-detached mode** for testing/validation workflows
2. **Document expected behavior** so users understand the interruption is normal
3. **Set reasonable timeouts** for detached commands (e.g., 10-15 seconds)

### Long-term Investigation
1. **Tool Enhancement**: Improve detection of command completion for detached processes
2. **Output Parsing**: Better recognition of success indicators like "Server detached with pid"
3. **Process Monitoring**: Distinguish between parent command completion and child process lifecycle

## Test Cases for Validation

```bash
# Test 1: Non-detached (should work normally)
bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000

# Test 2: Detached with timeout (current workaround)
bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000 --detach
# With explicit timeout: 15000ms

# Test 3: Build only (should work normally)  
bundle exec jekyll build

# Test 4: Alternative detached approach
nohup bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000 > jekyll.log 2>&1 &
```

## Related Issues

This might be part of a broader pattern with:
- Long-running server processes
- Commands that fork background processes  
- Commands with extensive warning/debug output
- Other development server tools (npm run dev, etc.)

## Impact Assessment

- **Frequency**: Affects all Jekyll serve operations with --detach
- **Severity**: Workflow interruption but not data loss
- **User Experience**: Confusing behavior requiring manual intervention
- **Development Impact**: Slows down local development testing cycles

## Next Steps

1. Document current workarounds for users
2. Test non-detached approach for reliability
3. Consider timeout-based solutions for detached processes
4. Monitor for similar issues with other development tools
