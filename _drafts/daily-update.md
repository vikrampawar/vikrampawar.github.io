Question A: 

As I'm focussing on Claude Code, I want to gather all the publicly available news updatets about Claude Code - websites, social media etc.

I want Claude Code to tell me the best possible way that can be quickly done.

Should I use a particular prompt and ask Claude Code or in Claude desktop?

Should prefer Sonnet or Claude?

Answer A:

For gathering publicly available Claude Code news updates efficiently, here's the best approach:

**Use Claude Code (Sonnet 4) with WebSearch tool** - This is your optimal choice because:
- Claude Code has direct access to WebSearch functionality 
- Sonnet 4 is the most capable model for research tasks
- You can search multiple sources in one conversation

**Recommended prompt strategy:**
```
Search for recent news, updates, and announcements about Claude Code from the following sources:
- Official Anthropic blog and documentation
- GitHub repositories and releases
- Tech news sites (TechCrunch, Hacker News, etc.)
- Social media (Twitter/X, Reddit)
- Developer communities

Focus on updates from the last 3-6 months and organize findings by source and date.
```

**Why not Claude Desktop:**
- Desktop version lacks web search capabilities
- Would require you to manually search and copy-paste information
- Less efficient for comprehensive research tasks

**Additional tips:**
- Use specific search queries like "Claude Code CLI updates 2024"
- Search for "Anthropic Claude Code" to avoid confusion with other code tools
- Check Anthropic's official channels first for authoritative information

This approach leverages Claude Code's strengths while minimizing manual work.

Question B:

What's the best way to get this as a feed done once every day and sent?  

Answer B:

For automated daily Claude Code news feeds, here are the best approaches:

**Option 1: GitHub Actions + Email (Recommended)**
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs daily
- Use Claude Code API to search for updates
- Send results via email using GitHub's notification system
- Completely free and reliable

**Option 2: Zapier/Make.com Integration**
- Set up daily triggers
- Connect to Claude API
- Send formatted results to email/Slack/Discord
- Small monthly cost but user-friendly setup

**Option 3: Simple Python Script + Cron**
```python
# Daily cron job that:
# 1. Calls Claude API with your research prompt
# 2. Formats results as digest
# 3. Sends via email/webhook
```

**Option 4: RSS/Feed Aggregator Approach**
- Use tools like Feedly or Inoreader
- Set up Google Alerts for "Claude Code" + "Anthropic"
- Combine with IFTTT for delivery automation
- Less comprehensive but simpler

**Recommended Implementation:**
1. Start with GitHub Actions (free, version controlled)
2. Use Claude API with your research prompt
3. Format as markdown digest
4. Email daily summary at preferred time

**Sample workflow frequency:** Run at 9 AM daily, skip weekends, include 7-day summaries on Mondays.

The GitHub Actions approach gives you the most control and reliability while being completely free.
