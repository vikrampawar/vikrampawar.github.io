## Strategy pattern


Define a family of algorithm, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable 

## Command pattern

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

This is not required in a language that has closures, as the required block of code can be sent directly to the method.

## Good and bad of patterns

Good common vocabulary

Design guide

Terrible implementation guide

Not a panacea 

Terrible religion

Combination of patterns are useful

You may not use patterns because it inhibits your creativity

## Patterns today

Many "classic" GoF patterns encapsulated or deprecated by language evolution

Iterator Command 

Paradigms beyond just object-orientation

Language dictates the patterns

OOP are large and coarse-grained - end up making data structures 

blub developer

understand the idiomatic patterns for your language/platform

clarity vs obscurity
