# Writing Tips from Claude to Me

## Purpose
This page contains a summary of the suggestions Claude makes after reviewing my writing. Add a number against each particular point and increment it if the same thing is violated in a new post that's reviewed. Add a separate vocabulary section where it suggests better vocabulary.

## Structure & Organization
- **Use clear section headers** to break up content and make it scannable (1)
- **Create a narrative arc**: Current situation → Past experience → Strategies → Decision → Future plans (1)
- **Add meta descriptions** for SEO and previews - make them compelling and specific (1)

## Grammar & Style
- Use "fewer than" for countable items (not "less than") (1)
- Avoid awkward constructions like "So didn't I feel" - rephrase for clarity (1)
- Watch for extra spaces between words (1)
- Be consistent with tense (past vs present) (1)

## Content Enhancement
- **Numbered lists** work well for strategies or step-by-step processes (1)
- **Provide context** - briefly explain what tools/services are for new readers (1)
- **Quantify when possible** - "5x increase" is clearer than "from £15 to £75" (1)
- **Use comparative context** - comparing to other subscriptions helps readers understand the significance (1)

## Engagement Techniques
- **Strong opening** - Jump right into the decision/action (1)
- **Personal experience** - Share specific challenges and solutions (1)
- **Forward-looking conclusions** - Tell readers what to expect in future posts (1)
- **Acknowledge trade-offs** - Being honest about hesitations makes the content more relatable (1)

## Technical Writing
- **Fix internal links** - Use full filenames for Jekyll posts (1)
- **Add relevant tags** - Include both specific (#claude-code) and general (#developer-tools) tags (1)
- **Strategic use of bold** - Highlight key concepts without overdoing it (1)

## Title Optimization
- Add subtitles for clarity: "Moving to Claude Code Max Plan - Why I Made the Jump" (1)
- Make titles outcome-focused rather than just descriptive (1)

## Vocabulary Improvements
### From "Moving to Claude Code Max Plan" post:
- "didn't feel the limitation" → "the limitation wasn't particularly painful" (more descriptive)
- "Yet I think I was able" → "Despite these constraints, I made significant progress" (stronger transition)
- "want to try out" → "eager to explore" (more engaging)
- "made sense for me" → "justified the investment" (more precise)
