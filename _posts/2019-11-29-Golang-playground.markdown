Go provides a easy to use environment to test simple Go code. It is called playground.

For example the below hello world program can be executed in Go playground.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, playground")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here is the [playground](https://play.golang.org/p/HmnNoBf0p1z)
