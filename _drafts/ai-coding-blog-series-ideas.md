# AI Coding Assistant Blog Series - Ideas & Outlines

Based on my experiences with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and AI coding assistants over the past 2+ years.

## 1. "GitHub Copilot After Two Years: A Senior Developer's Honest Review"

**Target Length:** 1200-1500 words

**Key Points:**
- Multi-year journey from early adoption to current usage
- Main use cases: autocomplete, command generation (F1 binding), example code, chat for code questions
- The productivity vs learning dilemma for senior developers
- Strategic flip-flopping between using/not using to maintain skills
- Why dependency became a concern even when productivity increased

**Hook:** "I've had a GitHub Copilot subscription for most of its existence, but I'm not sure I could say it made me more productive."

## 2. "The AI Assistant Productivity Paradox: When Help Becomes Hindrance"

**Target Length:** 1000-1200 words

**Key Points:**
- The false promise of pure productivity gains
- How AI can accelerate work while eroding fundamental skills
- The "crutch effect" when learning new technologies
- Why senior developers face different challenges than juniors with AI tools
- Strategies for balanced AI usage that preserves learning

**Hook:** "The same tool that saved me hours also made me worry I was forgetting how to code."

## 3. "Why Command Line is the Perfect Interface for AI Coding Assistants"

**Target Length:** 1200-1400 words

**Key Points:**
- Initial skepticism about CLI constraints vs GUI flexibility
- The revelation: "Right from day 1, I immediately could see why commandline is the best option"
- 30+ years of command-line evolution and programmatic control
- Every important program available as a command (even Git)
- The efficiency of bringing everything to you vs context switching
- How millions of programmers have essentially created the ultimate interface

**Hook:** "I thought a command-line coding assistant would be limiting. I was completely wrong."

## 4. "Claude Code vs GitHub Copilot: A Week That Changed My Workflow"

**Target Length:** 1300-1600 words

**Key Points:**
- Direct comparison of speed, accuracy, and workflow integration
- Why Claude rarely makes you wait (unlike Copilot's painful delays)
- Built-in features that I was manually trying to create in Copilot
- The killer feature: controlling what you see when you need to see it
- Real project example: SpringBoot with PostGIS and custom routing queries
- Working entirely without an editor while in VSCode terminal

**Hook:** "It's only been a week since I started using Claude Code, but I can already see it will be my main coding assistant for some time."

---

## 5. "The Memory Problem: Making AI Coding Assistants Actually Remember"

**Target Length:** 1000-1200 words

**Key Points:**
- Early frustrations with Copilot's lack of project context
- Manual solutions I built: documentation, memory systems, prompt saving
- Why built-in memory and context matter more than raw capability
- The difference between autocomplete and true assistance
- How proper memory changes the entire workflow dynamic

**Hook:** "I spent weeks building what should have been built into the AI assistant from day one."

---

## 6. "AI Coding Agents vs Legacy Codebases: The Reality Check"

**Target Length:** 1100-1300 words

**Key Points:**
- The hype around agentic coding (Replit, Cursor, etc.)
- Why these tools excel with greenfield projects but struggle with existing code
- Personal experience trying Replit on existing projects
- The complexity gap between demo projects and real-world systems
- When AI agents work vs when they become obstacles
- The SpringBoot project that worked vs the complex ones that didn't

**Hook:** "Every AI coding demo starts from scratch for a reason."

---

## 7. "The Cost of AI Coding: Per-API vs Subscription Models"

**Target Length:** 800-1000 words

**Key Points:**
- The psychological impact of usage-based pricing on exploration
- Why per-API costs make you optimize for cost instead of productivity
- The relief of moving to subscription models (£15/month starting point)
- How pricing models affect learning and experimentation
- The real cost of hesitation vs the real cost of usage

**Hook:** "Per-API pricing made me think about cost every time I wanted to ask a question."

---

## 8. "Anthropic's Minimalist Approach: Why Less is More in AI Tools"

**Target Length:** 900-1100 words

**Key Points:**
- The aesthetic minimalism: only two models (Sonnet and Opus)
- Command-line simplicity vs feature bloat
- The power of dogfooding (they use their own tools)
- Documentation quality when the company uses Claude to document
- Why fewer options often lead to better outcomes
- The "start small and discover yourself" philosophy

**Hook:** "In a world of feature-stuffed AI tools, Anthropic's restraint is revolutionary."

---

## 9. "From Autocomplete to Agent: The Evolution of AI-Powered Development"

**Target Length:** 1400-1700 words

**Key Points:**
- Personal journey through different AI coding paradigms
- Autocomplete era: powerful but limited
- Chat era: answering questions but context-switching
- Agent era: doing work but struggling with complexity
- Command-line agents: the current evolution
- What each generation taught about human-AI collaboration
- Predictions for what's next

**Hook:** "I've lived through every generation of AI coding tools. Here's what each one taught me."

---

## 10. "Building Better Prompts: Lessons from the AI Coding Trenches"

**Target Length:** 1200-1500 words

**Key Points:**
- Evolution from basic requests to sophisticated prompt engineering
- The strategy of creating batch scripts vs direct execution
- Learning to document what you want the AI to learn
- Prompt saving and iteration strategies
- The difference between prompting for autocomplete vs prompting for agents
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Templates and patterns that work

**Hook:** "The difference between good and great AI assistance isn't the model—it's how you talk to it."

## Series Publishing Strategy

**Recommended Order:**
1. Start with #4 (Claude Code vs Copilot) - most immediate/topical
2. Follow with #3 (Command Line Interface) - explains the foundation
3. Then #1 (Copilot Review) - provides historical context
4. Continue with others based on reader interest and feedback

**Cross-References:**
- Each post should reference relevant others in the series
- Create a series index page linking all posts
- Tag consistently for discoverability

**Additional Content:**
- Consider adding screenshots/demos for technical posts
- Code examples where relevant
- Links to tools and resources mentioned
