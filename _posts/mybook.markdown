Assume other people don't think like you. If they don't make sense, THEY are wrong. Tim is wrong, X is wrong.

Find somebody who thinks closer to you and has SEEN more than you and those OTHERS. Through him see what can be SEEN.

Know that the world is limited by what you can SEE. What you cannot see and experience doesn't exist.
