Yesterday I saw this announcement about creating [ai powered apps using Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/news/build-artifacts) while I was going to my office on the train.

So naturally I got very curious and wanted to try out immediately.

I give the URL and asked it to explain what it's talking about and then create an example for me to understand how it's used.

It created [AI Study Buddy](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/91da6736-672f-4f63-977c-57c798d04255). Initially, I saw a blank screen. I asked Claude to fix it and created a couple of more versions which were blank as well. Then it asked if I was using mobile app or browser. I was on the app, you suggested me to use browser. Even the first version worked perfectly on the browser. 

I created several other tiny apps they were surprisingly good for the effort I put in them. For some app, the first version didn't work well or had bugs, but I could ask Claude to fix them and it fixed them instantly.

These apps are create don Anthropic's infrastructure. You can easily share them as I shared the AI Study Buddy app mentioned above.
The recipients can update the app to their liking. Any Claude usage comes out of their own Claude account and not the creators. So creators are free to create and share without worrying about the usual tech things like API keys, hosting and also the worry that if the app becomes viral they have to foot the bill.
