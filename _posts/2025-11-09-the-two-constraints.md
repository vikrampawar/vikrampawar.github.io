# The Two Constraints

In my previous post about working with AI like an army of lieutenants, I talked about the human-in-the-loop being a limitation.

The constraint was on the output side: reviewing the output generated from LLMs. The AI can generate at 10x or 100x speed, but you still need to review everything. Your review capacity caps your actual throughput.

But there's another constraint I've discovered: we can't type fast enough. ⌨️

The input side is also a bottleneck.

We can speak very fast. Much faster than we can type. But here's the problem: if you speak in a different accent or if your speech is not very clear, what comes out needs a lot more work. So you end up not using voice tools that much.

Google Voice is really good. I do use it on my mobile phone, but every now and then, it's frustrating to see that it doesn't understand my accent or it misunderstands what I want. The biggest problem is the commas and full stops. And starting the sentence with a capital letter, etc.

So we have two constraints:
1. Review capacity (output side) - covered in my previous posts
2. Input capacity (typing speed) - the constraint I'm solving now

And there's another issue: RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury). Being able to speak means you don't have to worry about RSI from constant typing.

Speaking to express your ideas puts you in a very different mood and mode than writing them out. It's more natural, more flowing.

As somebody who spent several years as a developer, I'm not used to speaking that much. It doesn't come naturally to me, especially when I'm sitting in front of a computer by myself. I need to adapt. Because a lot of the future work is going to be talking to the LLM. The faster you can do it, the better.

And if you're talking for a very long time during the day, especially when you use older generation voice assistants, you end up shouting a lot or speaking in an unnatural voice.

I needed a tool that would remove this friction. A tool that would let me speak naturally, in my own accent, without shouting, and have it come out clean enough that I don't need to spend hours fixing it.

That's when I found .... [revealed tomorrow]
