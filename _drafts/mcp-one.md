This blog post is about creating your first mcp server and testing it.

I already have installed mcp servers in another machine (mac). 
This is linux machine are there are non involved.

When I installed mcp servers on mac, I found it a bit fidly, as I had some setup already on Claude Desktop which I assumed will be available and they were not available, and I later discovered a command that copies them.

Also all mcp servers were not available in all claude instances. Possibly because they were in different scopes, I didn't have a clear idea in scope the mcp servers were installed.

These are not big problems and as an experienced software developer I'd be able to resolve all these issues quite quickly.
I'd probably read documentation before I start and know and expect what to do and resolve quickly. 
However, with claude (and generally working with AI) I expect the tools to make it easy. And they do make complicated setups quite easy. So I'm a different mode with them. My mind isn't in the right place to fix such simple/silly issues.  

Reminds me of that scene in Pretty woman where Julia Roberts goes to an event/party with Richard Gere dressed very well and acting ladylike and then Richard's friend recognises her and talks rudely. Julia is completely taken aback and I think says something to the lines of she not being in the right place. When we were in a certain environment/setup, we behave in a certain way.

Anyway, I have done the following, and want the post to contain the commands used

- gave document link to claude
- had it install github mcp server at the user level 
- tested it manually that it works in another instance
